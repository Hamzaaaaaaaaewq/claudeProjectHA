# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

## Title

ADR-001: Adopt Microservices Architecture for SyriaMart Platform

## Status

Accepted

## Context

SyriaMart is being built as a large-scale e-commerce platform competing with established players like Rozetka. The platform needs to:

- Handle millions of products and thousands of concurrent users
- Support independent scaling of different components
- Enable rapid feature development by multiple teams
- Maintain high availability despite Syria's infrastructure challenges
- Support both online and offline capabilities
- Integrate with multiple payment providers and third-party services

The Syrian market presents unique challenges:
- Limited internet infrastructure (35.8% penetration)
- Frequent connectivity issues
- Need for mobile-first approach
- Multiple payment methods including mobile wallets

## Decision

We will adopt a microservices architecture with the following key components:

1. **Service Decomposition**: Break the platform into domain-driven microservices (User, Catalog, Order, Payment, etc.)
2. **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data with no shared databases
3. **API Gateway**: Single entry point for all client requests
4. **Event-Driven Communication**: Asynchronous messaging via Kafka/RabbitMQ
5. **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes for deployment and scaling
6. **Service Mesh**: Istio for inter-service communication

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed independently, reducing risk
- **Technology Diversity**: Teams can choose the best technology for their service
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on demand
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work independently on different services
- **Offline Capability**: Services can cache data locally for offline operation

### Negative

- **Complexity**: Distributed systems are inherently more complex
- **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication adds latency
- **Data Consistency**: Maintaining consistency across services is challenging
- **Operational Overhead**: More services to monitor and maintain
- **Testing Complexity**: Integration testing becomes more complex
- **Initial Development Time**: Longer initial setup compared to monolith

### Neutral

- **Team Training**: Developers need to learn microservices patterns
- **DevOps Investment**: Significant investment in CI/CD and monitoring
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation required
- **Service Boundaries**: Careful design of service boundaries needed

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Monolithic Architecture
- **Description**: Single deployable application with modular structure
- **Pros**: Simpler to develop initially, easier debugging, no network latency
- **Cons**: Difficult to scale specific features, technology lock-in, risky deployments
- **Why Rejected**: Doesn't meet scalability and team autonomy requirements

### Option 2: Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- **Description**: Coarse-grained services with shared databases
- **Pros**: Fewer services to manage, easier data consistency
- **Cons**: Still has scaling limitations, shared database bottleneck
- **Why Rejected**: Shared databases create coupling and scaling issues

### Option 3: Serverless Architecture
- **Description**: Function-as-a-Service for all business logic
- **Pros**: No infrastructure management, automatic scaling
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, cold starts, difficult for stateful operations
- **Why Rejected**: Not suitable for Syria's infrastructure limitations

## Notes

- **Implementation Timeline**: 3 months for core services
- **Responsible Team**: Platform Architecture Team
- **Review Date**: 2025-04-15 (after Phase 1 completion)
- **Migration Strategy**: Start with core services, gradually extract from prototype
