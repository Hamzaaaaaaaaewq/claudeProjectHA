## Impact

This update transforms the SyriaMart implementation plan from backend-only to a complete full-stack strategy. The frontend is now treated as an equal partner to backend services, with:

- **Equal rigor**: Same standards, testing, and quality gates
- **Specific adaptation**: Syrian market requirements deeply integrated
- **Measurable outcomes**: Concrete deliverables and metrics
- **Automated enforcement**: Quality guaranteed through automation
- **Risk mitigation**: Frontend-specific risks identified and addressed

The plan now properly addresses that users interact with interfaces, not APIs, ensuring SyriaMart can actually serve customers through well-designed, performant, and culturally appropriate user experiences.
